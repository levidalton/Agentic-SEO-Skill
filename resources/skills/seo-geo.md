# AI Search / GEO Optimization (February 2026)

## Evidence Warning

Treat every numeric claim, correlation, platform-specific tactic, and scoring weight in this file as a third-party hypothesis until its named source and methodology are checked live. Apply `resources/references/source-policy.md`. Google specifically advises relying on foundational SEO instead of special AEO/GEO tactics and states that Google Search ignores `llms.txt`.

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI Overviews reach | 1.5 billion users/month across 200+ countries | Google |
| AI Overviews query coverage | 50%+ of all queries | Industry data |
| AI-referred sessions growth | 527% (Jan-May 2025) | SparkToro |
| ChatGPT weekly active users | 900 million | OpenAI |
| Perplexity monthly queries | 500+ million | Perplexity |

## Critical Insight: Brand Mentions > Backlinks

**Brand mentions correlate 3× more strongly with AI visibility than backlinks.**
(Ahrefs December 2025 study of 75,000 brands)

| Signal | Correlation with AI Citations |
|--------|------------------------------|
| YouTube mentions | ~0.737 (strongest) |
| Reddit mentions | High |
| Wikipedia presence | High |
| LinkedIn presence | Moderate |
| Domain Rating (backlinks) | ~0.266 (weak) |

**Only 11% of domains** are cited by both ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query — platform-specific optimization is essential.

## GEO Analysis Criteria (Updated)

### 1. Citability Score (25%)

Treat passage length as descriptive evidence, not a universal AI-citation target. Prefer self-contained passages whose length follows the question and supporting evidence.

**Strong signals:**
- Clear, quotable sentences with specific facts/statistics
- Self-contained answer blocks (can be extracted without context)
- Direct answer near the beginning of a section when that structure serves the query
- Claims attributed with specific sources
- Definitions following "X is..." or "X refers to..." patterns
- Unique data points not found elsewhere

**Weak signals:**
- Vague, general statements
- Opinion without evidence
- Buried conclusions
- No specific data points

### 2. Structural Readability (20%)

**92% of AI Overview citations come from top-10 ranking pages**, but 47% come from pages ranking below position 5 — demonstrating different selection logic.

**Strong signals:**
- Clean H1→H2→H3 heading hierarchy
- Question-based headings (matches query patterns)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Tables for comparative data
- Ordered/unordered lists for step-by-step or multi-item content
- FAQ sections with clear Q&A format

**Weak signals:**
- Wall of text with no structure
- Inconsistent heading hierarchy
- No lists or tables
- Information buried in paragraphs

### 3. Multi-Modal Content (15%)

Content with multi-modal elements sees **156% higher selection rates**.

**Check for:**
- Text + relevant images
- Video content (embedded or linked)
- Infographics and charts
- Interactive elements (calculators, tools)
- Structured data supporting media

### 4. Authority & Brand Signals (20%)

**Strong signals:**
- Author byline with credentials
- Publication date and last-updated date
- Citations to primary sources (studies, official docs, data)
- Organization credentials and affiliations
- Expert quotes with attribution
- Entity presence in Wikipedia, Wikidata
- Mentions on Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn

**Weak signals:**
- Anonymous authorship
- No dates
- No sources cited
- No brand presence across platforms

### 5. Technical Accessibility (20%)

**AI crawlers do NOT execute JavaScript** — server-side rendering is critical.

**Check for:**
- Server-side rendering (SSR) vs client-only content
- AI crawler access in robots.txt
- Optional llms.txt presence, reported without a Google ranking recommendation
- RSL 1.0 licensing terms

---

## AI Crawler Detection

Check `robots.txt` for these AI crawlers:

| Crawler | Owner | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| GPTBot | OpenAI | ChatGPT web search |
| OAI-SearchBot | OpenAI | OpenAI search features |
| ChatGPT-User | OpenAI | ChatGPT browsing |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | Claude web features |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | Perplexity AI search |
| CCBot | Common Crawl | Training data (often blocked) |
| anthropic-ai | Anthropic | Claude training |
| Bytespider | ByteDance | TikTok/Douyin AI |
| cohere-ai | Cohere | Cohere models |

**Recommendation:** Allow GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot for AI search visibility. Block CCBot and training crawlers if desired.

---

## llms.txt Standard

The emerging **llms.txt** proposal provides optional structured content guidance for tools that explicitly support it. Google Search states that it ignores this file for ranking and generative-search visibility.

**Location:** `/llms.txt` (root of domain)

Do not score its absence as a defect or recommend creating it without a documented target consumer.

**Format:**
```
# Title of site
> Brief description

## Main sections
- [Page title](url): Description
- [Another page](url): Description

## Optional: Key facts
- Fact 1
- Fact 2
```

**Check for:**
- Presence of `/llms.txt`
- Structured content guidance
- Key page highlights
- Contact/authority information

---

## RSL 1.0 (Really Simple Licensing)

New standard (December 2025) for machine-readable AI licensing terms.

**Backed by:** Reddit, Yahoo, Medium, Quora, Cloudflare, Akamai, Creative Commons

**Check for:** RSL implementation and appropriate licensing terms.

## Platform-Specific Optimization

| Platform | Key Citation Sources | Optimization Focus |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Top-10 ranking pages (92%) | Traditional SEO + passage optimization |
| **ChatGPT** | Wikipedia (47.9%), Reddit (11.3%) | Entity presence, authoritative sources |
| **Perplexity** | Reddit (46.7%), Wikipedia | Community validation, discussions |
| **Bing Copilot** | Bing index, authoritative sites | Bing SEO, IndexNow |

---

## Output

Generate `GEO-ANALYSIS.md` with:

1. **GEO Readiness Score: XX/100**
2. **Platform breakdown** (Google AIO, ChatGPT, Perplexity scores)
3. **AI Crawler Access Status** (which crawlers allowed/blocked)
4. **Optional llms.txt Status** (informational; target consumer required for recommendations)
5. **Brand Mention Analysis** (presence on Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn)
6. **Passage-Level Citability** (optimal 134-167 word blocks identified)
7. **Server-Side Rendering Check** (JavaScript dependency analysis)
8. **Top 5 Highest-Impact Changes**
9. **Schema Recommendations** (for AI discoverability)
10. **Content Reformatting Suggestions** (specific passages to rewrite)

---

## Passage Indexing Optimization

Google Passage Indexing (active since 2021) ranks individual passages independently from the full page. This is critical for long-form content and pairs well with GEO citability.

### Rules for Passage-Optimized Content
1. **Self-contained sections**: Each H2 block should fully answer one clear question without requiring context from other sections
2. **Focused passages**: Keep each section self-contained and as long as its answer requires; do not use a fixed length as a ranking proxy
3. **Question-answer structure**: Use question-phrased H2/H3 followed by a direct answer in the first sentence
4. **No pronoun-heavy openings**: Start sections with the full subject, not "It" or "This" referring to previous sections
5. **Speakable schema**: Add `speakable` CSS selectors for your top answer passages

### Speakable Schema Implementation

```json
{
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [".answer-block", "#key-definition", ".summary-paragraph"]
  }
}
```

### Passage vs Full-Page Ranking

| Scenario | Google Behavior |
|----------|----------------|
| Strong overall page, weak section | Full page ranks |
| Weak overall page, one excellent section | That **passage** can rank for specific queries |
| Long FAQ page with 20 questions | Individual Q&A passages rank independently |

---

## Quick Wins

1. Add a clear "What is [topic]?" definition where it matches real audience demand
2. Create self-contained answer blocks with enough context and evidence to be useful
3. Add question-based H2/H3 headings
4. Include specific statistics with sources
5. Add publication/update dates

4. Improve real entity consistency across authoritative profiles

## High Impact

1. Create original research/surveys (unique citability)
2. Build Wikipedia presence for brand/key people
3. Establish YouTube channel with content mentions
4. Implement comprehensive entity linking (sameAs across platforms)
5. Develop unique tools or calculators
